# RDP C

Implementation attempt on Recursive Descent Parser on C Declaration/Definition.

## About

_RDP_ stands for Recursive Descent Parser, a tree-like algorithm that follows specific grammatical rules to recognize patterns. In this case, it attempts to implement the grammatical structure of C declarations. The algorithm processes both definitions and declarationsâ€”fun fact: they are actually different! (oversimplified definition, proofreaded by AI... am sorry)

## TODO's

- Error handling (stack & trace)
- Refactor
- Function for automated testing
- Add more reserved c keyword

## P.S.

This implementation is horrible, so feel free to give me any input! (be kind tho)
